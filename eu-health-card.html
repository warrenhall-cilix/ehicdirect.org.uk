            <h2>EU Health Card</h2>
            <p>An EU health card will allow you to access healthcare in the European Economic Area (EEA) which is state provided. This includes Switzerland, the treatment that you receive will be at a reduced cost or sometimes free of charge. The EU health card also covers any pre-existing medical conditions and maternity care, providing you are not visiting the country to specifically give birth. What cover you receive will depend on the country which you are visiting.</p>
                      <p> The EU health card is not an alternative to travel insurance as the EU health card will not cover you for any private medical healthcare or costs that you receive such as mountain rescue when visiting ski resorts, being flown back to the UK, or lost or stolen property for this type of cover you will need private travel insurance.</p>
                      <p>If you do require medical assistance whilst travelling you will need to let the hospital know that you have a valid EU health card, some European Health systems may expect you to pay for your bill when you are treated and then claim back the costs when you arrive back in the UK, please remember to keep all receipts and paperwork as this may be required when making a claim. To make a claim call The Overseas Healthcare team on telephone number 0191 218 1999.</p>
                      <p> Before travelling please ensure that your card is still valid, the EU health card is valid for 5 years and can be renewed 6 months prior to the expiry date stated on the EU health card.  <a href="apply.html">Click here</a> to renew your EU health card for yourself and other family members which include any dependent children and a spouse/partner.

                      <p> If you have never had an EU health card you can make an application quickly by <a href="apply.html">clicking here.</a> Once your application has been checked and processed by an agent it can then take between 7-10 working days to receive your EU health card in the post.
