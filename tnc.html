    <p>4. How The Contract is Formed Between You and Us</p>
    <p>4.1 After placing an order and completing the Application Form, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your Application Form. This is our acceptance of your offer to use our Services.</p>
    <p>4.2 The Contract is formed following our acceptance in accordance with condition 4.1 and your payment in accordance with condition 8. Until both payment is made and our acceptance is given, no contract has been formed.</p>
    <p>5.1 Cancellation and Refunds</p>
    <br/>
     As stated by the Consumer Contracts Regulations “The right to cancel can be lost during the cancellation period if the service is provided in full before the 14 days elapses”. Our service fee is for the review, submission and optional reminder service that we provide and we are not able to undo our service. By availing our service, you authorise EHIC Direct to start the work immediately and will not be entitled to cancel once your order has been placed. Our processing team work in real time and will in many cases have started the review of your application within minutes of you submitting your application online. Submission of your application to the NHS can take up to 48 hours. For applicants that do not enter an email address when applying it will be impossible for EHIC Direct to send an email confirming when the work has started on the application, therefore Ehic Direct will log the date and time on the applicants file.
              <br/>
    As stated by the Consumer Contracts Regulations  “The right to cancel can be lost during the cancellation period if the service is provided in full before the 14 days elapses”. Our service fee is for the review, submission and optional reminder service that we provide and we are not able to undo our service.
    If your application cannot be processed due to the fact that you, or any person on your application is already registered with a valid EHIC a refund will not be granted as our checking and review services will have been completed prior to your application being submitted to the NHS.
    Refund requests must be submitted by email to terms@ehicdirect.org.uk. Any refund that may be agreed on an exceptional basis will be subject to a £10 admin fee.
    </p>
