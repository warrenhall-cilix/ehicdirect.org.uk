                        5. Cancellation and Refunds<br/>
                        <br/>
                        As stated by the Consumer Contracts Regulations “The right to cancel can be lost during the cancellation period if the service is provided in full before the 14 days elapses”. Our service fee is for the review, submission and optional reminder service that we provide and we are not able to undo our service. By availing our service, you authorise Ehic Direct to start the work immediately and will not be entitled to cancel once your order has been placed. Our processing team work in real time and will in many cases have started the review of your application within minutes of you submitting your application online. Submission of your application to the NHS can take up to 48 hours.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        If your application cannot be processed due to the fact that you, or any person on your application is already registered with a valid EHIC a refund will not be granted as our checking and review services will have been completed prior to your application being subitted to the NHS.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Refund requests must be submitted by email to support@ehicdirect.org.uk. Any refund that may be agreed on an exceptional basis will be subject to a £10 admin fee.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        5.4 This provision does not affect your other statutory rights as a consumer.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        6. Termination of Service<br/>
                        <br/>
                        6.1 We reserve the right to cancel or terminate our Contract with you at any time and for any reason at our sole discretion. Should we terminate our Contract with you we will refund all (or a proportionate part of) your payment made in accordance with condition 8 but such refund will be in our sole and absolute discretion.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        6.2 For the avoidance of doubt no refund will be given in the event the Service is terminated due to your failure to comply with any of these terms and conditions and you have failed to remedy such failure upon being given notice of the same or in the event we believe you have provided us with false or misleading information<br/>
